Health is your heart rate. When the bar is full it's reading your heart rate, if it's empty, it's not reading any pulse.  

Shield is your battery percentage.  
Shield highlight will turn red if your battery level is 30 or lower.

The XP bar is your current steps towards your daily goal.  
Your current Lv (level) is the amount of flights of stairs you've climbed today.
